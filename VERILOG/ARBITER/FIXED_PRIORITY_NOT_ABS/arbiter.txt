The nextGrant generator will only get the nogrant HIGH value if no grant is active (noGrant = 1).

Which indicates no grant has been granted and we can grant access to a system even of  usually low priority if it rises request if all the higher priority systems dont rise request at the same time.

If a grant bit is active, the grant bit is held at level 1 if the request remains level 1.

This design is to make sure that even if a lower priority system has been granted access last cycle
if this cycle a high priority system asks for access we wont override the low priority system which was a concern in the FIXED_PRIORITY_SIMPLE design
