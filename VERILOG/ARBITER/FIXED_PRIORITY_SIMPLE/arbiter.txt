1)
The issue with the fixed priority arbiter is that if any high priority system rises a request continuously
the low priority systems never get the grant and this leads to STARVATION.
2)
If a system of low priority (A) has the access of the system and is doing a certain job but in the next cycle 
if a higher priority system (B) raises a request then A is forced to stop the access and B gets the grant.
