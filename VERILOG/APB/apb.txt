To introduce WAIT STATES:
  if we want to have WAIT state included then we need  pready signal.
  pready can be HIGH or LOW when penable is LOW but when penable is HIGH --> ACCESS MODE if we want to wait in that access mode 
      We nead pready ---> LOW
      All the other signals should remain the same(ACCESS MODE) until pready is HIGH again only then transaction is complete.
